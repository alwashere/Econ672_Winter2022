% Question 1
\question{1}
    \begin{enumerate}[\indent a.]
        \item \textcite{Persico2004} are examining the mechanism that 
        influences the relationship between height and earnings gap. They note 
        that previous studies have evaluated the influence of current height.  
        They take advantage of the fact that height changes throughout youth 
        before becoming relatively constant in adulthood. 
        \citeauthor{Persico2004} find that height at 16 is a predictor of 
        future earnings controlling for vocation, family attributes and adult 
        height.
        
        \item Two data sets are evaluated: 1) Britain's National Child 
        Development Survey (NCDS) and the US's National Longitudinal Survey of 
        Youth (NLSY) 1979 cohort.

        \item Table 1 shows the raw heights, change in heights and their 
        distributions for white men in the two data sets. 
        \citeauthor{Persico2004} include this data because it is the key 
        parameter of interest.  The characteristics and distributions of these 
        heights provide important context for the conclusion of the authors.

        \item Table 2 shows various statistics for sample.  It includes 
        traditional determinants of wages include individual and family 
        educational attainment, martial status, and number of siblings. Finally, 
        Table 2 contains the ln(wages) which is the dependent variable.

        \item Table 3 shows various OLS estimates for effect on ln(wages) 
        using the controls from Table 3.  The estimates show a positive return
        to ln(wages) for full-time white male workers based on reported height 
        during youth. The reduced form specification shows a positive and 
        statistically significant positive return to wages based on adult 
        height. However, the return due to adult height diminishes and is 
        no longer statistically significant when youth height is added to the 
        specification.
                
        \item \citeauthor{Persico2004} explore the relationship between height 
        at various stages of development age 7, 11 and 16 in addition to adult 
        height.  The table shows that the height premium is only statistically 
        economically significant at age 16 when all heights and family 
        characteristics are included.
        
        \item The primary conclusion of the paper is that height when a 
        teenager is the primary contributor to adult wage differential rather 
        than adult height.  The authors tested for height as indicator of 
        several factors including health, availability of external resources, 
        and intergenerational factors.  There appears to be an identified 
        mechanism that associated with height that produces a future wage 
        premium. The authors suggest this premium is gained through greater 
        social participation of the taller respondents. This premium is present 
        independent of career choices. 
        
        Additionally, the wage premium is high enough that receiving growth 
        hormone treatments to increase teen height has a positive return.

% Question 2
\question{2}
    \begin{enumerate}[\indent a.]
        \item[b.]
            \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
                \item NLSY contained 3 subsamples: a cross-sectional sample that 
                represented noninstitutionalized civilian population, a 
                sample that oversampled civilian Latino, black and other 
                economically disadvantage civilians, and a sample representing 
                the population that was in the military.  After the 1984, most 
                members of the military where ineligible for interview so 201 
                members of that cohort were randomly selected to remain. After 
                the 1990 interview, the economically disadvantaged white 
                population was removed from the sample as noted in the analysis 
                by \textcite{Persico2004}.

                \item The survey collected information about the respondents 
                family background and family formation. They collected 
                information about the respondents education background including 
                high school, college, and/or vocational training as well as a 
                standardized test of general ability, ASVAB. Finally, the survey 
                collected information about labor participation, government 
                program participation, and income and assets.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item[f.] Height data is available in 1981, 1982,1985, 2006, 2008, 2010 
        2012, 2014. 2016, 2018.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item The reduced form specification (1) shows similar results to 
    \textcite{Persico2004}.  There statistically and economically significant 
    returns to wages for taller men.  An additional inch will increase wages 
    by 3\% holding all else equal. Including family characteristics as 
    controls in regression (2) reduces the return to adult height to 2.3\%. 
    It remains economically and statistically significant. Considering teen 
    height in specification (3) further reduces the returns to adult height. 
    Finally, considering teen height and family characteristics in specification 
    (4) reduces the returns to adult height to an economically small value 
    while return to youth height remains about the same as specification (3). 
    
    Unlike \textcite{Persico2004}, the returns to teen height are statistically 
    indistinguishable from zero in specification (3) and (4). This 
    maybe to the different samples evaluated.  The authors used a sample of 
    2,063 responses while I only had 860 valid responses. The general trends 
    in the results we of the same direction.
